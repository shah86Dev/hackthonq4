# Locomotion and Gait Control

Bipedal Walking and Dynamic Balance

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand bipedal locomotion principles

- Implement gait control algorithms

- Analyze balance and stability

## Prerequisites

- chapter5


## Bipedal Walking Dynamics

Bipedal locomotion is one of the most challenging aspects of humanoid robotics. This section covers the dynamics of walking, including center of mass control, foot placement, and balance maintenance during gait transitions.
