# Embodied Cognition

How Body Shape and Physics Influence Intelligence

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand embodied cognition principles

- Analyze the role of morphology in intelligence

- Design morphology-aware AI systems

## Prerequisites

- chapter1

- chapter2


## Morphological Computation

Embodied cognition emphasizes that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's body, environment, and control system. Morphological computation refers to the idea that the physical properties of a body can simplify computational tasks.
