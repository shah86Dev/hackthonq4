- Understand conservation laws in neural networks

- Apply PINNs to robotics problems

## Prerequisites

- chapter9


## Physics-Informed Learning

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) incorporate physical laws directly into the learning process. This approach ensures that learned models respect fundamental physical constraints such as conservation of energy and momentum.
