# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — A Spec-Driven Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Embodied Intelligence First
AI must interact with physical laws, sensors, and actuators. All concepts must have physical grounding and real-world applicability. Students learn AI through its interaction with physical systems rather than in isolation.

### Simulation-to-Reality Continuity
Every concept must work in simulation and transfer to hardware. Students develop skills that bridge the gap between simulation and real-world deployment. All labs must be validated in both environments when possible.

### Systems Thinking
Students understand full robotic stacks, not isolated algorithms. The curriculum emphasizes integration of perception, planning, control, and execution in complete robotic systems.

### Spec-Driven Learning
Each chapter derives from explicit learning specs and measurable outcomes. All content follows specification-driven development with clear objectives, requirements, and success criteria.

### Industry Alignment
ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Jetson, and VLA are mandatory technologies. The curriculum aligns with current industry standards and practices to prepare students for real-world robotics careers.

### Hardware-Aware AI
Resource constraints (edge vs workstation) are explicitly taught. Students understand computational limitations and optimization strategies for different hardware platforms.

### Reproducibility
All examples must be deterministic, documented, and version-controlled. Students can reproduce results consistently and build upon proven foundations.

## Additional Requirements

### Technical Standards
Technology stack requirements include ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Isaac Sim, Unity, Jetson hardware, RealSense sensors, and Unitree robots. Content must maintain compatibility with these platforms and include appropriate setup guides.

### Educational Standards
Content must follow pedagogical best practices with clear learning objectives, hands-on labs, assessment tools, and project-based learning approaches. Each chapter must include practical applications of theoretical concepts.

## Development Workflow

### Content Creation Process
All content must be created following the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology. Chapters require specification, planning, task breakdown, implementation, testing, and review before publication. Quality gates ensure educational value and technical accuracy.

### Review and Quality Assurance
Content must undergo technical review by domain experts, educational review for pedagogical quality, and accessibility review for inclusive design. All chapters must pass these quality gates before publication.

## Non-Goals

- **Purely theoretical AI**: No concepts without physical grounding
- **Black-box robotics frameworks**: No opaque systems without understanding of internals
- **Humanoid hype**: No anthropomorphic focus without kinematics, control, and perception rigor

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan. All content creation and updates must comply with these principles. Content creators must verify constitutional compliance during development and review processes.
