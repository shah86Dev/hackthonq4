# Prompt History Record

## PROMPT_TEXT
This project uses a token-efficient agent architecture.
LLMs must never load MCP tool schemas directly.
All heavy logic must execute in scripts.
Only skill instructions and final outputs enter context.
/sp.constitution

## RESPONSE_TEXT
I'll help you update the project constitution based on your input. First, let me check if the constitution file exists:

[File content of constitution.md was shown]

I can see that the constitution file already exists and contains specific principles for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. The user's input about the token-efficient agent architecture appears to be additional information about the project's technical approach, rather than a change to the core principles in the constitution.

Based on the user's input about the project architecture, I'll update the constitution to include these important architectural principles. Let me update the constitution file:

[New version: 1.1.0 with token-efficient architecture principle added]
