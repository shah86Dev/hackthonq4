# Sim-to-Real Transfer

Bridging Simulation and Reality

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand sim-to-real challenges

- Implement domain randomization

- Evaluate transfer performance

## Prerequisites

- module1

- module2


## Domain Randomization and Transfer Learning

Sim-to-real transfer is crucial for Physical AI, allowing policies learned in simulation to work in the real world. This section covers domain randomization, system identification, and reality gap minimization techniques.
