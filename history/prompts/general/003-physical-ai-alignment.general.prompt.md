## Prompt

yes align with

## Response snapshot

Created an updated specification, implementation plan, and task breakdown for the Book-Embedded RAG Chatbot that aligns with the Physical AI constitution by incorporating embodied intelligence, simulation-to-reality continuity, and required technologies (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Jetson hardware, etc.).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully aligned the RAG chatbot feature with Physical AI constitution requirements
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated spec, plan, and tasks to include physical AI integration
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with implementation of aligned physical AI RAG system
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution alignment required fundamental changes to transform text-based system into embodied AI system

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - successfully aligned feature with constitution requirements
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
